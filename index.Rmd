My name is Diana Hackenburg and I am a PhD student in the Rubenstein School at the University of Vermont. I study the connections between human well-being and nature, as well as communication, education and community action related to the environment, specifically algal blooms. Before coming to Vermont, I worked as a science writer/editor with North Carolina Sea Grant, as well as with Triangle Land Conservancy, Virginia Department of Environmental Quality, and the Blue Ridge Land Conservancy.
